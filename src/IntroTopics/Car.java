// vehicle is parent class 
// bike and car are child classes


// single (parent to child)
// multilevel (parent to child to grandchild)
// hierarical inheritance  (parent to child1, parent to child2)
// hybrid (combo of more than 1 type of inheritance)

// multiple (parent1, parent2 to child) --> exactly opposite to hierarical (This type of inheritance is not supported in java)
// we can make it support. (Interfaces)

// pillers of OOPS:

// encapsulation (Wrapping up of data members and member functions into single unit is called)
// polymorphism (method over-loading and method over-riding)
// inheritance 
// abstraction
